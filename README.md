**Curriculum Module**  
_Created with R2022b. Compatible with R2022b and later releases._ 

## Description ##
This curriculum module contains interactive [live scripts](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/live-editor.html) that teach fundamental concepts of fluid mechanics. Topics addressed include dimensional analysis, control volume analysis, internal flow analysis, mass, momentum, and energy conservation equation. You can explore various fluid dynamics applications from your home plumbing to leaving the earth’s orbit and flying on another planet.

You can use these live scripts as demonstrations in lectures, class activities, or interactive assignments outside class. The module is divided into five interactive instructional scripts and one project.

## Get started with the fluid mechanics interactive examples ##

**Option 1: Download to Desktop** Download and unzip the repository. Then, double-click the Fluiddynamics.prj` file inside MATLAB&reg;. 

**Option 2: [![Open in MATLAB Online](https://www.mathworks.com/images/responsive/global/open-in-matlab-online.svg)](https://matlab.mathworks.com/open/github/v1?repo=MathWorks-Teaching-Resources/Fluid-Mechanics&project=fluid-mechanics.prj)** Log in to your MathWorks account to access your license. If you are associated with a university, use your university email to access a license.

- From there, you can follow the landing page instructions to get started with the examples. 
- The instructions inside the live scripts will guide you through the exercises and activities. 
- Get started with each live script by running it one section at a time. 
- To stop running the script or a section midway (for example, if a loop is running longer than intended), click the <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88841524/182219991-17ef7bf9-369b-4463-8de6-9e440ca3bc9b.png"> **Stop** button in the **RUN** section of the **Live Editor** tab in the MATLAB Toolstrip.
