<Info description="This curriculum module contains interactive MATLAB® live scripts  that teach fundamental concepts of fluid mechanics. This module currently includes a single script exploring Apollo 11’s launch in 1969. This script is a step-by-step walk through the control volume method and the development of a theoretical model of the first phase of the launch. More scripts covering internal flow, dimensionless analysis, and pipe network will be released this year, so stay tuned!"/>
