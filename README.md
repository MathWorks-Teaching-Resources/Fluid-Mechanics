**Curriculum Module**  
_Created with R2022b. Compatible with R2022b and later releases._ 

## Description ##
This curriculum module contains interactive [live scripts](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/live-editor.html) that teach fundamental concepts of fluid mechanics. This module currently includes a single script exploring Apollo 11’s launch in 1969. This script is a step-by-step walk through the control volume method and the development of a theoretical model of the first phase of the launch. More scripts covering internal flow, dimensionless analysis, and pipe network will be released this year, so stay tuned!

These lessons can be used as part of a lecture, as activities in an instructional setting, or as interactive assignments to be completed outside class.

## Get started with the fluid mechanics interactive examples ##

**Option 1: Download to Desktop** Download and unzip the repository. Then, double-click the Fluiddynamics.prj` file inside MATLAB&reg;. 

**Option 2: [![Open in MATLAB Online](https://www.mathworks.com/images/responsive/global/open-in-matlab-online.svg)](https://matlab.mathworks.com/open/github/v1?repo=MathWorks-Teaching-Resources/Fluid-Mechanics&project=fluid-mechanics.prj)** Log in to your MathWorks account to access your license. If you are associated with a university, use your university email to access a license.

**Solutions are available upon instructor request.** If you would like to request solutions or have a question, contact the <a href="mailto:onlineteaching@mathworks.com">MathWorks online teaching team.</a>

- From there, you can follow the landing page instructions to get started with the examples. 
- The instructions inside the live scripts will guide you through the exercises and activities. 
- Get started with each live script by running it one section at a time. 
- To stop running the script or a section midway (for example, if a loop is running longer than intended), click the <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88841524/182219991-17ef7bf9-369b-4463-8de6-9e440ca3bc9b.png"> **Stop** button in the **RUN** section of the **Live Editor** tab in the MATLAB Toolstrip.

## Prerequisite Domain Knowledge ##
This module assumes some familiarity with the mass and momentum conservation equation and the control volume method. A complete understanding of the method is optional, and additional definitions are included in the script.
