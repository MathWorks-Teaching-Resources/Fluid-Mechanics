# Information

This curriculum module contains interactive [MATLAB® live scripts](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/live-editor.html) that teach fundamental concepts of fluid mechanics. Topics addressed include dimensional analysis, control volume analysis, internal flow analysis, mass, momentum, and energy conservation equation. You can explore various fluid dynamics applications from your home plumbing to leaving the earth’s orbit and flying on another planet.

## Background

You can use these live scripts as demonstrations in lectures, class activities, or interactive assignments outside class. The module is divided into five interactive instructional scripts.


The instructions inside the live scripts will guide you through the exercises and activities. Get started with each live script by running it one section at a time. To stop running the script or a section midway (for example, when an animation is in progress), use the <img src="README_media/image_0.png" width="19" alt="image_0.png"> Stop button in the **RUN** section of the **Live Editor** tab in the MATLAB Toolstrip.

## Prerequisites

These scripts assume knowledge common with basic derivative and integral calculus and common mechanical and thermodynamics concepts such as energy and temperature. There is minimal MATLAB and Simulink knowledge required to complete the module. ManOnTheMoon is the only script that comes with no expected knowledge computing knowledge. It is highly encouraged to complete additional training for the rest of the module, starting with   and [Introduction to Symbolic Math with MATLAB](https://matlabacademy.mathworks.com/details/introduction-to-symbolic-math-with-matlab/symbolic). Those interested in additional training should consider completing [Simulink Onramp](https://matlabacademy.mathworks.com/details/simulink-onramp/simulink) & [Simscape Onramp](https://matlabacademy.mathworks.com/details/simscape-onramp/simscape) as a further learning exploration.

## Getting Started
### Accessing the Module
### **On MATLAB Online:**

Use the \href{https://matlab.mathworks.com/open/github/v1?repo=MathWorks-Teaching-Resources/Fluid-Mechanics&project=fluid-mechanics.prj}{<img src="README_media/image_1.png" width="154" alt="image_1.png">} *(edit Open in MATLAB Online link accordingly)* link to download the module. You will be prompted to log in or create a MathWorks account. The project will be loaded, and you will see an app with several navigation options to get you started.

### **On Desktop:**

Download or clone this repository. Open MATLAB, navigate to the folder containing these scripts and double-click on [fluid-mechanics.prj](matlab: openProject("fluid-mechanics.prj")) *(edit text and hyperlink accordingly)*. It will add the appropriate files to your MATLAB path and open an app that asks you where you would like to start. 


Ensure you have all the required products ([listed below](#H_E850B4FF)) installed. If you need to include a product, add it using the Add-On Explorer. To install an add-on, go to the **Home** tab and select  <img src="README_media/image_2.png" width="16" alt="image_2.png"> **Add-Ons** > **Get Add-Ons**.
