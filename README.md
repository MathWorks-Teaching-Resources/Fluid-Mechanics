**Curriculum Module**  
_Created with R2022b. Compatible with R2022b and later releases._ 

## Description ##
This curriculum module contains interactive [live scripts](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/live-editor.html) that teach fundamental concepts of fluid mechanics. This module currently includes a single script exploring Apollo 11’s launch in 1969. This script is a step-by-step walk through the control volume method and the development of a theoretical model of the first phase of the launch.

These lessons can be used as part of a lecture, as activities in an instructional setting, or as interactive assignments to be completed outside class.

## Get started with the CURRICULUM MODULE NAME interactive examples ##

**Option 1: Download to Desktop** Download and unzip the repository. Then, double-click the PROJECT_NAME.prj file inside MATLAB&reg;. 

**Option 2: [Open in MATLAB Online](https://matlab.mathworks.com/open/github/v1?repo=MathWorks-Teaching-Resources/REPO-NAME&project=PROJECTNAME.prj)** Log in to your MathWorks account to access your license. If you are associated with a university, use your university email to access a license.

**Solutions are available upon instructor request.** If you would like to request solutions or have a question, contact the <a href="mailto:onlineteaching@mathworks.com">MathWorks online teaching team.</a>

- From there, you can follow the landing page instructions to get started with the examples. 
- The instructions inside the live scripts will guide you through the exercises and activities. 
- Get started with each live script by running it one section at a time. 
- To stop running the script or a section midway (for example, if a loop is running longer than intended), click the <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88841524/182219991-17ef7bf9-369b-4463-8de6-9e440ca3bc9b.png"> **Stop** button in the **RUN** section of the **Live Editor** tab in the MATLAB Toolstrip.

## Prerequisite Domain Knowledge ##
This module assumes some familiarity with the mass and momentum conservation equation and the control volume method. A complete understanding of the method is optional, and additional definitions are included in the script.
